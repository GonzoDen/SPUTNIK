There are two ways of launching program:

1. Creating a virtual environment
This might be needed when you have multiple programs running on different versions of python and using different packages. Sometimes some packages can work only on specific versions of python (this happened to me last year that's why I used Conda virtual environment). As I changed my computer + all these got fixed, I decided to go with the option 2.

2. Setting all in Terminal (basic environment):
- Installing nltk, tensorflow: these are non-built-in libraries, so you will have to install them using 
"pip3 install nltk"
"pip3 install tensorflow"
 
- Failure with downloading script:
I wasn't able to download "punkt" resource. There was a failure in the downloading script, so I had to download it manually:
	1. Go here: http://www.nltk.org/nltk_data/
	2. Move it to folder (MacOS): /usr/local/share/nltk_data/tokenizers

- SSL certification failure:
For a more serious work, I suggest you go through explanation provided here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27835619/urllib-and-ssl-certificate-verify-failed-error
As this is a pet project, I focused more on the problem of failure itself, so try including this to your code:
	import ssl
	ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context

Great thanx to the StackOverflow community!
